# gdocwiki

A wiki based on Google Doc / Drive.

## Getting Started

1. Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/), [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)

2. Install dependencies:

   ```shell
   yarn
   ```

3. Create `.env.local` file for configuration. See [Configuration](#configuration) section below.

4. Start a local development server:

   ```shell
   yarn start
   ```

5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000

## Configuration

You should set up a configuration for local development and building by creating a `.env.local` file. This file is not needed for deployment, since it is embedded into the artifact during the building process.

A sample `.env.local` file could be:

```plain
REACT_APP_GAPI_KEY=xxxxxxx
REACT_APP_GAPI_CLIENT_ID=xxxxxxx
REACT_APP_ROOT_ID=xxxxxxx
REACT_APP_ROOT_DRIVE_ID=xxxxxxx
```

- `REACT_APP_GAPI_KEY`: The Google API Key.

  Google API Key can be obtained by following the [Setting up API keys](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158862) documentation.

- `REACT_APP_GAPI_CLIENT_ID`: The Google API OAuth Client ID.

  The OAuth Client ID can be obtained by following the [Setting up OAuth 2.0](https://support.google.com/googleapi/answer/6158849) documentation.

  Steps in the "User consent" section in the documentaton above should be completed as well, with the following scopes added:

  - `auth/drive`
  - `auth/documents`

- `REACT_APP_ROOT_ID`: The ID of the Google drive folder that you want to display as the wiki root folder.

  There may be hyphens in the ID. The wiki root folder is not limited to a sub-folder in the shared drive. It could be the shared drive root folder.

  **Note**: Only folders in the "[Shared drives](https://support.google.com/a/users/answer/9310351)" are supported. Folders in the "My Drive" are not supported.

- `REACT_APP_ROOT_DRIVE_ID`: The drive ID where your wiki root folder belongs.
